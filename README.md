# Intraoperative CT augmentation for needle-based liver interventions

Official implementation of the MICCAI 2023 paper - [_Intraoperative CT augmentation for needle-based liver interventions_](https://inria.hal.science/hal-04167447/file/MICCAI2023_Intraoperative_CT_augmentation_for_needle_based_liver_interventions.pdf)


# Introduction

We adresse the need for improved CT-guidance during needle-based liver procedures (i.e., tumor ablation), while reducing the need for contrast agent injection during such interventions. To achieve this objective, we augment the intraoperative CT with the preoperative vascular network deformed to match the current acquisition. A neural network learns local image features in a non-contrasted CT image by leveraging the known preoperative vessel tree geometry and topology extracted from a matching contrasted CT image. Then, the augmented CT is generated by fusing the labeled vascular tree and the non-contrasted intraoperative CT.

Finally, the augmented CT is created by fusing the segmented image and labels with the intraoperative non-contrasted CT.")
